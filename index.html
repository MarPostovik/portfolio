<div class="aboutme">
	<p> Hi! My name is Mariia Postovik. I am 15 years old. I live in Zhytomyr. I study at Lyceum â„–31, and I'm in the tenth grade. </p>
	<p>I study very well at school and participate in the Olympiads. Quite recently, I was engaged in hip-hop dancing. Earlier I did sports aerobics.
		 I had been doing aerobics for 7 years and I have the title of "Candidate for Master of Sports in Sports Aerobics".
		  Also, I have recently finished courses on the basics of journalism. I also have two younger brothers, whom I often have to take care of.
		   They are an important part of my daily life. </p>
		<p>I have many interests. I love learning languages. I learn English, German, and Polish. I love to travel. I was in several countries. Namely: Turkey, Georgia, Poland, Croatia, and Bulgaria. I love to read. I can spend a whole day on this. I especially like fantasy books and novels. I also like to watch movies and series. It helps me to relax.</p>
		
		<p> I am also interested in programming and want to connect my future life with it. This profession has many advantages. If I am a programmer, I will be able to create something new and interesting for other people.
			I will also have a flexible schedule, which is very important to me. And I will also be able to work remotely, which will allow me to travel a lot.
		I want to visit a lot of places and see a lot of things because I live only once and I want to explore this huge world to the maximum in my short life.</p>
	
			<p>I made this site entirely by myself. It shows my achievements in web design courses. It's not much, but it's just the beginning. I hope there will be more achievements in the future.</p></div>
